## Introduction

This module adds a section in the plugin settings called `Logs` where the logs can be managed.

## Installation

* Run composer `require woosa/logger:<version>` in the plugin's root directory. Alternatively, you can add `"woosa/logger": "<version>"` directly in `composer.json` and then run `npm start`
